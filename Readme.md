## <a name="what" />What's this repository? </a>

I'm trying to learn/brush up on different programming techniques. This includes using Git, Markdown, VS Code, and of course, C++. This is my place to practice code, and a place where I can refer to it later on.

## <a name="new"/>What's New?</a>

I'm currently in the process of importing some of my coding exercises that I've been playing with. I was starting to open new projects and work with them standalone. However, short of creating new repositories for each of them, I felt they were all new tools that belonged in the garage.

So, I'm adding them in as new classes, as in "in this class, we will learn the following topics. See, it's like a play on words, so even better. 

Check out [Homework.md](/Homework.md) for a running list of what's been imported and what's to come.

## <a name="dad"/>About this repository </a>

Growing up, we had two garages. One attached to the house where my father made the model trains, and a second detached garage where he played with them. We called them Garage #1 and Garage #2. Garage #2 had trains in different sizes; Standard Gauge, O-Gauge, HO Gauge, and a layout that circled the entire garage. Garage #1 was filled with all the tools that made those trains. It had milling machines, a lathe, and toolchests full of tools. Garage #1 was his workspace. 

In honor of my father, this is my "Garage Number One", my workspace.
