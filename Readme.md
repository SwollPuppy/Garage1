# Garage #1

## What's this repository?

I'm trying to learn/brush up on different programming techniques. This includes using Git, using Markdown, VS Code, and of course, C++ with Visual Studio. This is where I want to practice code.

## About this repository

Growing up, we had two garages. One attached to the house where my father made the model trains, and a second detached garage where my dad played with the trains. The entire garage had a Standard Gauge and a couple of O Gauge tracks that circled the entire garage.

The main point is that like my dad with his first garage, this is the workbench.
