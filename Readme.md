## <a name="what" />What's this repository? </a>

I'm trying to learn/brush up on different programming techniques. This includes using Git, Markdown, VS Code, and of course, C++. This is my place to practice code, and a place where I can refer to it later on.

## <a name="dad"/>About this repository </a>

Growing up, we had two garages. One attached to the house where my father made the model trains, and a second detached garage where he played with them. We called them Garage #1 and Garage #2. Garage #2 had trains in different sizes; Standard Gauge, O-Gauge, HO Gauge, and a layout that circled the entire garage. Garage #1 was filled with all the tools that made those trains. It had milling machines, a lathe, and toolchests full of tools. Garage #1 was his workspace. 

In honor of my father, this is my "Garage Number One", my workspace.
